# Real-time Biosignal Monitor

This project is a multi-port, multi-channel signal viewer developed using Python and Qt. It is designed to allow users to load, visualize, and manipulate various biosignals in real-time. The application provides powerful tools for signal viewing, manipulation, gluing, and exporting, tailored to both rectangular and polar views.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

### Signal Viewing üñ•Ô∏è

- **File and Real-time Signal Access**: Users can open signal files from their local system or connect to live websites that emit real-time signals.
- **Multiple Graphs**: The application supports two identical graphs that can display different signals simultaneously.
- **Linked Graphs**: Users can link the graphs to synchronize time frames, signal speed, and zoom levels.
- **Polar Graphs**: A non-rectangular graph is available for displaying signals in polar view.
- **Cine Mode**: All signals are displayed in cine mode, enabling users to view signals running through time.

### Live Signal Monitoring üì°

- Users can connect to real-time websites (e.g., YouTube subscriber counts) and visualize dynamic fluctuations in their favorite creator's subscriber numbers.

### Signal Manipulation üîß

The application provides a variety of tools for manipulating signals via a user-friendly interface:

- **Signal Customization**: Change signal colors, add labels, and adjust titles.
- **Signal Visibility**: Show or hide signals within the graphs.
- **Cine Speed Control**: Adjust the playback speed of signals.
- **Zooming and Scrolling**: Zoom in/out and pan through the signals for detailed analysis.
- **Playback Controls**: Pause, play, or rewind signals at your convenience.
- **Graph Movement**: Move signals between different graphs seamlessly.

### Signal Gluing üîó

- **Cut and Glue**: Users can select specific segments of signals from the rectangular graphs and combine them into a third graph.
- **Customizable Glue Parameters**: Fine-tune the glue operation with options such as window start, size, signal gap/overlap, and interpolation order.

### Exporting and Reporting üìë

- **Report Generation**: After performing glue operations, users can generate detailed reports that include snapshots of the glued signal graph and data statistics.
- **PDF Export**: Reports are generated in PDF format with a structured layout, including tables for data statistics.

### Polar and Rectangular Views

The application distinguishes between two types of signal display modes:

1. **Rectangular View**: Signals are displayed using traditional rectangular graphs, ideal for standard time-domain signals.
2. **Polar View**: A specialized non-rectangular graph is used to visualize signals in polar coordinates, which is helpful for certain types of biosignal analysis.
